### EXECUTION GUIDE ###
#######################

1. This current program will search everything from our research therefore, before continuing,
   comment out any location and search item which you do not wish to analyze.
2. Once completed installing the mentioned packages, simply run your python via your prefered
   method. We recommend staying in your terminal and change directory to where the file
   is located. Simply run the following command: python [filename(python.py)]
3. The file may be missing authorization tokens, fill that out using your twitter App's tokens
4. Once the file executes successfully, there should be a file containg all that were analyzed
   tweets, named run0Tweets.txt.
5. There will also be a file name run0Percentages.txt containing all the percentage values
6. A py plot will pop up with pi graphs depending on location and searched item, filter as needed.
